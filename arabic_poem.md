# قصيدة المتنبي (Al-Mutanabbi's Poem)
### By Al-Mutanabbi (المتنبي)

## Original Arabic
الخَيلُ وَاللَيلُ وَالبَيداءُ تَعرِفُني  
وَالسَيفُ وَالرُمحُ وَالقِرطاسُ وَالقَلَمُ

إذا رأيتَ نيوبَ الليثِ بارزةً  
فلا تَظُنَّنَّ أنَّ الليثَ يبتسِمُ

## English Translation
The horse, the night, and the desert know me well,  
As do the sword, the spear, the paper and the pen.

When you see the lion's fangs bared,  
Don't think that the lion is smiling.

# Oh Brief Candle

From Shakespeare's Macbeth, Act 5, Scene 5:

> Out, out, brief candle!
> Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
> That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
> And then is heard no more: it is a tale
> Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
> Signifying nothing.

This profound soliloquy is spoken by Macbeth upon learning of Lady Macbeth's death, reflecting on the brevity and meaninglessness of life. The "brief candle" metaphor beautifully captures the fragility and temporary nature of human existence.
